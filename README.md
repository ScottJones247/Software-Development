The purpose of a repository is to store versions of files so that you can acces them while you work on your program. It allows to make copies of your current version to safeguard that the current version is allways working. With public repositiores it allows multiple people to edit and change the same program together.
I love robotics, programming and mechanics. I have been taugt Java, Javascript, Python, and Arduino and freuquently do my own side projects to expand my skills. I have taken these classes to move forward towards my goal of being a robotics engineer. By the end of this course I hope to have a solid understanding of the Java programming language so that I may use it to prgram my own personal projects.
